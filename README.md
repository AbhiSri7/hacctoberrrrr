<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
TEST.


### Built With

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Sci-Kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The project consists of three stages:
1. Data Processing
2. Model Definition
3. Model training, and evaluation

The .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) file contains the three stages of the project.

## Data Processing

Data Processing refers to the analysis, manipulation/transformation of the dataset to obtain a usable form of the data.<br>
This consists of data partitioning, tokenization, padding, etc.

## Model Definition
 
Model definition refers to the process of choosing the models those are best suited for the dataset, along with the initial hyperparameters.

## Model Training, and Evaluation
 
Model training refers to the process of fitting the models to the training data.<br>
Model evaluation refers to the process of evaluating the process of the models using certain appropriate evaluation metrics and tuning the hyperparameters again based on the results.<br>
<br>
It is an iterative process until required performance is obtained. 



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This model can be used to analyse the sentiment in a given piece of text. This has its various applications such as:<br>
* Spam Classification
* Business Analytics
* Social Monitoring
* Market Research
* Product Analysis


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/soundarzozm/IMDb-Sentiment_Analysis/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
